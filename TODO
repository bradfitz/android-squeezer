* Cache album art's Drawable from Activity#onRetainNonConfigurationInstance()
  so it doesn't need to be re-retrieved from the network.

* Pandora like/dislike buttons.

* Pandora disable back button when in Pandora mode.

* screen/sleep lock option? "party remote mode"

* use NIO for parsing input and allocate less big Strings objects in
  the service.

* When switching from SqueezerActivity to settings, we disconnect from
  the service, so the service unsubscribes from the server, which
  means we don't get song position updates anymore.  Then when switching
  back to the SqueezerActivity, the time is behind for a second.
  Possible Solutions:

     -- dead-reckoning calculation by service?
     -- easier: have SqueezerActivity tell Service not to unsubscribe
        for 'n' seconds?

* When pressing pause, an in-flight "playing" status update can come in
  and then the status flip-flops between playing & paused a couple times.
  We should keep track of our own pause events and suppress any play
  events from the network for 1-2 seconds.
