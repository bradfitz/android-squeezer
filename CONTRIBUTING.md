# How to contribute

Your contributions to Squeezer are very welcome. Exactly how to do that
depends on what you want to do.

## Reporting bugs and feature requests

Please use the
[issues page](https://github.com/nikclayton/android-squeezer/issues) to
report bugs or suggest new features.

It's appreciated if you take the time to see if someone else has already
reported it, and if so, add a comment to their note.

## Translations

The easiest way to contribute, especially if you are not a programmer,
is to help translate Squeezer's interface in to different languages.

There's more information on how to do that at
[Translating Squeezer](https://github.com/nikclayton/android-squeezer/wiki/Translating-Squeezer).

## Small bug fixes

If you've discovered a bug and want to fix it, or you'd like to have a go
at fixing a bug that's already been reported, please go right ahead.

You can also review the
[list of open bugs](https://github.com/nikclayton/android-squeezer/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Abug)
if you want inspiration for something to work on.

Please see the [Co-ordination](#Co-ordination) section if you think the
fix is going to be particularly complex, or if it touches lots of
files. The [How to contribute code](#How-to-contribute-code) section
has technical details on how to contribute code.

## Larger features

Contributing larger features to Squeezer is also very welcome. For these
please review the [Co-ordination](#Co-ordination) section, and let us
know what you plan on working on, so we don't end up duplicating too much
effort.

Please see the [How to contribute code](#How-to-contribute-code) section
for technical details.

## Co-ordination

There's a mailing list, android-squeezer@googlegroups.com.

To subscribe, go to the
[web interface](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/android-squeezer).

Say "Hi", and let us know what you'd like to work on.

## How to contribute code

This guide assumes you have already downloaded and installed the Android
SDK, in to a directory referred to as $SDK.

### Fetch the code

Follow [GitHub's instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo)
for forking the repository.

### Checkout the code

We (roughly) follow the branching model laid out in the
[A successful Git branching model](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)
blog post.

Specifically:

*   The `master` branch is generally kept pristine. No development work
    happens here.

*   The `develop` branch is for small bug fixes or other cleanups that need
    no more than a single commit to complete.

*   All other work happens on separate branches, branched from `develop`.

*   When those branches are complete and ready for release they are merged on
    `develop`.

*   New releases are prepared by creating a release branch from `develop` and
    working there, before merging changes from the release back to `develop`
    and `master`.

### Starting work

Suppose you want to start work on contributing a new feature. After fetching
the repository checkout a new local branch from develop with:

    git checkout -b new-branch-name develop

Then work on `new-branch-name`, pushing it up to GitHub as appropriate. Feel
free to have discussions on the mailing list as you're working.

### Keeping up to date with `develop`

As you're working other changes may be happening on the origin `develop`
branch. Please use `git rebase` to pull in changes from `develop` to ensure
your branch is up to date and that the future merge back in to `develop` is
straightforward. To do that (assuming you have no open changes on your
current branch):

```
git checkout develop  # Checkout the develop branch
git pull              # Fetch the most recent code
git checkout -        # Checkout the previous branch
git rebase develop    # Rebase current branch from develop
```

### Android Studio configuration

*   Run Android Studio

*   If you have no projects open then choose "Import project" from the dialog
    that appears.

    If you already have a project open then choose File > Import Project...

*   In the "Select File or Directory to Import" dialog that appears, navigate
    to the directory that you fetched the Squeezer source code in to and
    select the build.gradle file that ships with Squeezer.

*   In the "Import Project from Gradle" dialog tick "Use auto-import" and
    make sure that "Use gradle wrapper (recommended)" is selected.

*   Copy `ide/intellij/codestyles/AndroidStyle.xml` to Android Studio's config
    directory.

    -   Linux: `~/.AndroidStudioPreview/config/codestyles`
    -   OS X: `~/Library/Preferences/AndroidStudioPreview/codestyles`
    -   Windows: `~/.AndroidStudioPreview/config/codestyles`

*   Go to Settings (or Preferences in Mac OS X) > Code Style > Java, select
    "AndroidStyle", as well as Code Style > XML and select "AndroidStyle".
